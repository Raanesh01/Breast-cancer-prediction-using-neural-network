# Breast-cancer-prediction-using-neural-network

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using a neural network model. The model is designed to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on patient diagnostic data, providing an AI-powered solution to aid in early detection and decision-making.

## Features
1) Classification of breast tumors into benign or malignant categories.
2) Neural network architecture designed for high accuracy and generalization.
3) Preprocessing techniques for clean and reliable input data.
4) Robust evaluation metrics to ensure model reliability.

## Technologies used

### Programming Language: Python

### Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras: Neural network implementation
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing
Scikit-learn: Data splitting and evaluation metrics
Matplotlib: Data visualization

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing:
Normalized and scaled features for consistent input to the neural network.

### Model Development:
1) Built a feedforward neural network with multiple layers.
2) Used ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid activation for the output layer.
3) Optimized hyperparameters like validation and epochs.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using accuracy score

### Prediction:
Used the trained model for predicting breast cancer diagnosis based on input data.
